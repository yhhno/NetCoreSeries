Contains the security and authorization middlewares for ASP.NET Core.

A list of community projects related to authentication and security for ASP.NET Core are listed in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/community).

### Notes

ASP.NET Security will not include Basic Authentication middleware due to its potential insecurity and performance problems. If you host under IIS you can enable it via IIS configuration.


This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
